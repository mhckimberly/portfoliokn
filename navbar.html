      <h3 class = "section" id ="context">CONTEXT</h3>
      <h1 class = "section-title">What is Sightseer?</h1>
      <p  class = "section-paragraph"><span style="color:#E47239"><strong>Received 2nd place at the 2023 Catalyst Designathon hosted by BU FORGE Design Studio!</strong></span><br><br>Sightseer is a mobile application designed to empower the local communities by connecting them to tourists and to steer away from commercialization in the tourist industry allowing them to <strong>explore the world through the eyes of a local.</strong></p>

      <h3 class = "section" id = "problem">PROBLEM</h3>
      <h1 class = "section-title">Large corporations taking away from locals.</h1>
      <p class = "section-paragraph">According to Statista, tourism contributed roughly $5.8 trillion USD to the global economy in 2021. But how much of this contribution cycles through local communities? The United Nations Environmental Programme has found that for every $100 spent by a tourist, only $5 stays within the local economy. Majority of this money flows into the pockets of large corporations, who use these funds to continue gentrifying and changing the native landscape to appeal to tourists. As popular destinations continue to cater to short-term visitors, the locals are pushed aside as their history is erased away.<br>As many developing countries depend on tourism as the backbone of their economy, it is necessary that we begin correcting this uneven distribution of wealth. We believe that it’s time to start bringing attention back to local communities and small business owners. We believe that it’s time we start giving back to the locals.
      </p>

      <h3 class = "section" id ="solution">Solution</h3>
      <h1 class = "section-title">Empower locals with a tour guide app for tourists
      </h1>
      <p  class = "section-paragraph">In order to give back to the locals, we needed to create a way for locals to gain passive income. Hence, the birth of Sightseer. With Sightseer, locals can post curated tours based on their knowledge as a native. Each tour would retail for around $10 to $20 and upon purchase, tourists would be able to guide themselves along the provided route at their own pace.<br>As a tourist, you’re visiting someone else’s hometown – what better way to get around than with a local friend at a low price point? As locals create these tours, they could even lead tourists through their own small businesses or family owned restaurants. <br>With this solution tourists are gaining a unique experience, and locals are gaining passive income with the potential to boost their existing earnings.</p>

      <h3 class = "section" id="contribution">MY CONTRIBUTION</h3>
      <h1 class = "section-title">Flow 3</h1>
      <p  class = "section-paragraph">I worked closely with my team members, Ellie and Maciej. I worked solely on Flow 3 from conducting research to delivering the final craft.</p>

      <h3 class = "section" id ="learnings">Learnings</h3> 

<h1 class = "section-title">Animations!</h1>
      <p  class = "section-paragraph">Upon participating in the designathon, I drew on my basic experience working with Figma in my UI/UX course. However, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to expand my knowledge by creating a functional mobile prototype within a tight timeframe of just 2 days! Remarkably, our team secured the 2nd place spot in the highly competitive "Travel" category.</p>

      <p class = "section-paragraph">One of the most exciting challenges I tackled was developing an integrated map with a marker that would dynamically track the user's location. Utilizing smart animations, I was able to bring my vision to life and design an interface that exceeded my expectations.</p>
        
      <p class = "section-paragraph">The process was incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling, providing me with invaluable insights that will undoubtedly inform my future endeavors.</p>

      <h3 class = "section" >Thank you!</h3>
      <p class = "section-paragraph">Thank you for reading my case study!</p>
